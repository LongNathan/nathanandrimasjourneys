      <h1 id="me">Why do we do this?</h1>
      <p id="what">
        Nathan and Rima enjoy documenting their journeys together and to share
        their experiences in Russia (Where they currently are.) as an American
        and Filipina or elsewhere in the world. They both love to travel to new
        places and enjoy the local atmosphere and cuisine as well as get
        acquainted with the local customs and culture. The main reason why they
        like to share their experiences is to give other people an idea of what
        some of these other places have to offer to the rest of the world and to
        also share the culture and experiences of the people that they have
        visited. They have been to and have seen places all over the world from
        America all the way to Europe and Asia and there are many interesting
        sights and sounds that deserve to be recognized and praised by other
        people and the only way to get their stories across is by videoing it
        and sharing it to others on platforms such as YouTube. They are always
        happy and excited to be able to capture whatever life wants to throw at
        them and feel that they should always remain positive no matter what the
        outcome of it might possibly be. They may not always post weekly, but
        that is because of their personal lives do not always allow them to be
        able to document the realities of what is occurring around them at that
        moment, but they always try to find something interesting that can be
        shared and will always share it. So they hope that you will enjoy this
        ride of their journeys together with them and will always find
        happiness.<br /><br />
        Nathan and Rima do their best with the equipment that they have and with
        your help they could get better equipment and software to make their
        videos with and to be able to go to different places and hopefully
        interview some people there. It would be greatly appreciated if you
        could support them in making their dreams come true. Your support could
        be as simple as subscribing to their channel and liking and sharing
        their videos and while it is not your responsibility to support us
        whatsoever any donations would be received with great thanks. If you do
        decide to donate to Nathan and Rima you would get credited in their
        videos with depending on how much you donate to them. You can donate to
        them by simply going to our Patreon page and subscribing by clicking
        on the “P” on the menu on the top or on the bottom of this webpage and
        decide which level you want to give your support and donation to. If you
        have a product that you want us to sponsor for you or your company,
        please click on the “Contact Us” button above and they will be happy to
        discuss the sponsorship with you. They hope that you will consider
        helping them in their journeys and their dreams by making this a full
        time job for them and they promise that you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />
        Everyone has that spark and curiosity in them about traveling and
        exploring new places and cultures all the way from our ancestors leaving
        Africa many thousands of years ago to all the way to Neil Armstrong and
        all the other Apollo Moon astronaut explorers and at this moment in
        human exploration we are looking ever further off this planet and into
        the deepest darkest areas of space to explore and settle with Mars close
        on the horizon. It is within our genes to have an urge to learn more
        about the places we live in and the need to try anything and everything
        even if it brings great risk to ourselves and it is with that attitude
        of our ancestors that Nathan and Rima will bring to you. How about it?
        Will you join Nathan and Rima on this journey through life?

            watching Sci-Fi movies and TV shows. Whenever Nathan travels he
            likes to experience the local culture and cuisine so he can feel
            what it is like to live there even if for a short time. Nathan as
